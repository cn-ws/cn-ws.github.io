# Welcome to CN-WS

This website holds the documentation for CN-WS and related projects. Curve-Number/WaTEM-SEDEM (CN-WS), and is a model used to estimate erosion, water run-off and overland sediment routing and transport to river. This page links to the several packages and codes used in the CN-WS project.

The CN-WS project is currently split in three sections:

1. The core CN-WS Pascal code.
2. The pycnws package, a Python data processing and formatting package.
3. The [R-factor package](https://github.com/cn-ws/rfactor), used to compute the rainfall erosivity. Have a look at the extended [documentation](https://cn-ws.github.io/rfactor/index.html) for this package.
